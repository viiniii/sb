In order to understand how the world works, our brains are too inefficient. I say with great confidence that with our brain we are not able to realize and understand many things.  Just like a domestic cat is not able to understand the microcontroller device in a robot vacuum cleaner. So I think the first subtask of the main task is to increase the efficiency of the brain's thought processes. This way it will be easier to comprehend all the secrets of the universe. Let's attribute number 1 to this task.
Task 1 also needs to be divided into smaller subtasks. I feel that I lack knowledge about the principles of the brain function. So in the next step I will put forward my main thoughts and assumptions about how the brain works and try to understand in more detail what I do not know in this matter. Let it be task 1.1.
