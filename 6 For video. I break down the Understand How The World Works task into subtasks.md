In order to understand how the world works, our brains are too inefficient. I say with great confidence that with our brain we are not able to realize and understand many things.  Just like a domestic cat is not able to understand the microcontroller device in a robot vacuum cleaner. So I think the first subtask of the main task is to increase the efficiency of the brain's thought processes.
In order to break this subtask into even smaller subtasks, I feel that I lack knowledge about the principles of the brain function.
In the next video I will put forward my main thoughts and assumptions about how the brain works. Then I plan absorbing other people's concepts in this issue. Thus, I expect to find a direction in which I will be confident enough to move along it to my goal.
