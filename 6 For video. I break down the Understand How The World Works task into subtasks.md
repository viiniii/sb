To understand how the world works, our brains are too inefficient. I say with great confidence that with our brain we are not able to realize and understand many things.  Just like a domestic cat is not able to understand a microcontroller device in a robot vacuum cleaner. So I came to a conclusion the first subtask of the main task is to increase efficiency of brain's thought processes. This way it will be easier to comprehend all the secrets of the universe. Let's attribute number 1 to this subtask.
Task 1 also needs to be divided into smaller subtasks. I believe that in order to succeed in task 1, it is extremely desirable to understand principles of brain function. So in the next step I will put forward my main thoughts and assumptions about how the brain works and try to understand in more detail what I do not know and what I must know in this matter. Let it be task 1.1.
